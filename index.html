        <p id="Bob-description"> Hello! My name is Bob Daniels and I am the CEO of the company <em>Oh Noes</em>
        </p>
        <p id="bd2"> <em> Debugging Service. I'm a multi-trillionare who was once a homesless man because of the lack of education I had as a young man. After finally receiving education, I was able to start this buisness and become the man I am today.</em></p>
        <h2 id="mygoal">My goal</h2>
        <h6>Last updated: 4/24</h6>
        <p> <strong>My Goal: </strong>Create a non profit organization that gives free education.</p>
        <h2 id="wysdtm">Why you should donate to me</h2>
        <h6>Last updated: 4/24</h6>
        <p id="why">The reason why you should donate ties back to my own personal experience. </p>
        <p id="w2">If nobody gave me free education, I would still be the homeless man I was 20 years ago. From my own hardships, I've realized that the only way that one can become successful is through getting education. There are hundreds of millions of people today who can't afford education, and my goal is to end this crisis.</p>
